# Workflow to build and test wheels
#
# Wheels:
#   This uses `cibuildhwheel` to build wheels. Each version is built inside a docker
#   container downloded by `cibuildwheel`. The steps are as follows:
#   1. Compile the CPP
#   2. Use `cibuildwheel` to build the wheels from the compiled code
#   3. Test the wheels
#
# Source dist:
#   We use regular python, there are 2 steps:
#   1. Build the sdist
#   2. Test the sdist
#
# If the commit is tagged with something like `v*`, the final files are uploaded to github
# as a release and can be downloaded locally and uploaded to PYPI using `twine`.
